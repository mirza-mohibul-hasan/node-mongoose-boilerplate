# Node-Mongoose-Boilerplate

This project is a Node.js boilerplate for building web applications with Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication. It provides a simple and extendable structure for building RESTful APIs with user registration, login, and protected routes. This project is ideal for developers who want a starting point for building their own full-stack web applications.

## Features

- User Authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- User Registration with password hashing
- User Login to generate JWT token
- Protected Routes requiring JWT authentication
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose
- Error Handling Middleware
- Environment Variable Support with dotenv

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas cluster)
- Postman for testing the API

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mirza-mohibul-hasan/node-mongoose-boilerplate.git
cd node-mongoose-boilerplate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=3000
```

Replace `your_jwt_secret_key` with a strong, random secret key for signing JWT tokens.

Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Endpoints

}
```

**Response:**

```json

```

### 2. POST /api/v1/users/login

}
```

### 3. GET /api/v1/users/profile (Protected Route)
